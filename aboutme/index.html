        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Trevor Lutie Thompson, the oldest of three siblings, currently on the journey towards obtaining a Ph.D. I have fond memories of my early years in Los Angeles until the age of 4, after which my family moved to Bakersfield, California. Growing up, I developed a love for riding horses and exploring the outdoors.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            As I approach my 19th birthday, I've been passionate about programming for the past 6 years. It's been an exciting journey of learning and growth in the world of technology.
